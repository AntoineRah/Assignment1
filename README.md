# making a portfolio: the artist woodkid
## The content of the project
the project consists of the landing page containing general information about the artist 
it also has the navigations elements towards the about me page and the projects page
and i planned to make contact us dynamic using javascript
### about page
Contains a bit more info about Woodkids background with a button to navigate back to home page
### projects
Contains 2 of his best albums released to this day
### contact us
Contains links to insta and twitter page
## Decision making:
### home
styled using tailwindcss.I failed trying to make contact us dynamic with javascript as i was crunched on time
due to having exams week starting monday
### about me
styled using vanilla css
### projects
i decided to style thi page with vanilla css, the user here can navigate through woodkid's albums, where the covers change dynamically with javascript
## Challenges
the main challenge here was learning tailwind syntax, which i found to be easier to use than vanila css.
reading tailwind's official documentation helped me a lot to overcome this challenge.
I also faced a challenge making contact us more dynamic, with hover animation for the links.
